## Technologies Used  
In this backend development project, we are utilizing the following technologies:  
- Programming Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
- Web Framework: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)  
- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

These technologies were chosen for their robustness, scalability, and extensive community support, ensuring a stable and efficient backend system.

## Project Structure  
The project is structured as follows:  

```
backend-development/
├── app/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── serializers.py
│   ├── views.py
│   └── ...
├── config/
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── ...
├── manage.py
└── ...
```

The `app/` directory contains the application logic, including models, serializers, and views.  
The `config/` directory contains the project-level configuration files, including settings and URL routing.  
The `manage.py` file is the Django management script used for various project-related tasks.  

# Setup and Installation  
To set up the backend development environment, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-development.git`  
Change to the project directory: `cd backend-development`  
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended): [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) or [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) can be used.  
Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

# Running the Backend  
To run the backend development server, execute the following command:  
`python manage.py runserver`  
The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Ensure that the required database is set up and configured correctly in `config/settings.py`.  

# API Documentation
The backend development API endpoints are documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). After running the server, access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`.
